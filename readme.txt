To configure the plugin, you need a valid Telegram API token. Its easy to get starting a Telegram Bot.
You can learn about obtaining  tokens and generating new ones in 
[this document](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather/ "Obtaining tokens and generating new ones")  
or follow the info in [this post](https://medium.com/shibinco/create-a-telegram-bot-using-botfather-and-get-the-api-token-900ba00e0f39 "Create a Telegram bot using BotFather and Get the Api Token")  

You also need at least one "chatid" number, that is the recipient to the message will be send. To know you personal chatid number, search on telegram app for "@get_id_bot" or  
[click here ](https://telegram.me/chatIDrobot/ "@chatIDrobot")  OR  another bot @RawDataBot [click here ](https://t.me/RawDataBot)  


Once You got the 2 fields save the configuration and try the "TEST" button .. you should receive a message in you telegram : "WOW IT WORKS" !! If not, check token and chatid fields again for the correct values.

** WOOCOMERCE FILTER HOOKS **

We have created 4 filter hooks for WooCommerce order notification message. 4 new positions: Message Header, Message Footer, before Items, and after Items. And we have created a filter through which you can add custom code to product rows, and if you want, you can replace and customize the entire row. :

4 new Positions and code axample ( echo payment_status in the 4 positions)

`<?php
add_filter('nftb_order_header_message_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1); 
add_filter('nftb_order_before_items_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1);
add_filter('nftb_order_after_items_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1);
add_filter('nftb_order_footer_message_hook', 'my_filter_function', 10, 1);

function my_filter_function($order_id) {
  $order = wc_get_order($order_id);
  if ($order) {
      // Get order details
      $order_data = $order->get_data();
  
      // Extract specific order information
      
      $payment_status = $order->get_status();
      $payment_method = $order->get_payment_method();  
  }
  return  "\r\n\r\n".$payment_method."(".$payment_status.")\r\n" ;
}
?>`

Product rows Filter with 2 different behaviors ADD or REPLACE LINE 

`<?php
add_filter('nftb_order_product_line_hook', 'my_item_line_function', 10, 3);

function my_item_line_function($message ,$product_id, $item) {

    // ADD SOME CODE $product_id TO ORIGINAL row $message.
    $modified_data = $message. "->".$product_id. "\r\n";

    // REPLACE Product ITEM LINE CODE WITH YOUR CODE  without concatenate $message.
    $modified_data = $product_id. "\r\n";

    return $modified_data;
} 
?>`

** USER LOGIN HOOKS **

`<?php
//Filter to add code on user login notification message
add_filter('nftb_login_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);

//Filter to add code  on user registration notification message
add_filter('nftb_user_registered_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);

//Filter to add code when existing user fails login notification message
add_filter('nftb_existing_user_fails_login_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);

//Filter to add code when unknown user fails login notification message
add_filter('nftb_unknown_user_fails_login_notification', 'custom_message_modifier', 10, 1);
  
  

// ADD User registration date to notification message
function custom_message_modifier( $user_id) {

    $user_info = get_userdata($user_id);

    if ($user_info) {
        $registration_date = $user_info->user_registered;
        $timestamp = strtotime($registration_date);
        $locale = 'it_IT'; // Italian locale
        
        $formatter = new IntlDateFormatter($locale, IntlDateFormatter::LONG, IntlDateFormatter::LONG, 'UTC');
        $formatter->setPattern('d MMMM y HH:mm:ss');
        
        $formatted_date = $formatter->format($timestamp);
        $message =  "\r\n\r\nUser gistration Date: " . $formatted_date."\r\n\r\n";
    } else {

      $message =  "\r\n No info about user ! \r\n " ;

    }
   

    return $message;
}
?>`



before the hooks we introduced 3 function so you can add things in message without changing the plug code 
We keep them for compatibility but encourage the use of hooks!!
Position in the order message are:  before items, after items, product_line

1) before the product list : (add order ID example)

	<?php function nftb_order_before_items($order_id){
    		return "ORDER ID : ".$order_id; 
		} ?php>


2) after the product list: (add order Currency example)

	<?php function nftb_order_after_items($order_id){
	 	$order = wc_get_order( $order_id );
    		$data = $order->get_data(); // order data
    		return "Currency: ".$data['currency']; 
		} ?php>

3) at the end of the line of each individual product of the order: (add product slug example)

	<?php function nftb_order_product_line($product_id,$item){
   		 $product = wc_get_product( $product_id );
    		return " | ".$product->get_slug()." ";
			} ?php>

Creating a new bot
Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an authorization token for your new bot.

The Username is a short name, to be used in mentions and t.me links. Usernames are 5-32 characters long and are case insensitive, but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. Your bot's username must end in 'bot', e.g. 'tetris_bot' or 'TetrisBot'.

The token is a string along the lines of 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw that is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API. Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
